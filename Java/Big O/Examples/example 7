Equivalent to O(N):
O(N + P)
    where P < N/2
N is the dominant term
drop the O(P)

Equivalent to O(N):
O(2N)
drop constants
is O(N)

Equivalent to O(N):
O(N + log N)
O(N) dominates O(log N)
drop O(log N)


NOT equivalent to O(N):
O(N + M)
No established relationship between N and M;
    keep both variables
