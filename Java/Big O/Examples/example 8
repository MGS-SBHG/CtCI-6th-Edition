Have an algorithm that
    took in array of strings
    sorted each string
    sorted the full array

s = length of the longest string
a = length of the array

sort each string = O(s log s)
    for every string
    there are "a" nbr of strings
takes O(a*s log s) time

sort all the strings
    need to compare the strings
        each comparison takes O(s) time
        there are O(a log a) comparisons
takes O(a*s log a) time

add the two parts
Big O runtime = O(a*s(log a + log s))
